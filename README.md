## How to use:
  # The first number is the total width of your opening
  # The second number is the minimum size of the material you want to be centered 
  # The third number is the maximum size of the material and is optional.
  # If you do not add the third number, the program will give you results from the single minimum value
  # This program only returns whole numbers. Nothing is rounded. Decimal numbers are discarded as they serve no purpose in keeping brushes on grid.
